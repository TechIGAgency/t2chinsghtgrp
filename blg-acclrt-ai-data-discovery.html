                <h5 class="text-primary mt-4">🛠 Engineering Best Practices</h5>
                <p style="color: #000000; text-align: justify;">To implement scalable, secure, and smart AI data discovery, engineers should:</p>
                <ul class="mb-4">
                    <li style="color: #000000;"><p><b>🧱 Adopt Modular Pipelines with Fabric and Azure ML:</b> Instead of building rigid, monolithic workflows, use modular pipelines that break down data processing and AI tasks into reusable components. With Microsoft Fabric and Azure Machine Learning, you can orchestrate these components flexibly, making it easier to scale, test, and adapt your AI solutions as data and business needs evolve.</p></li>
                    <li style="color: #000000;"><p><b>🔍 Leverage Semantic Search and Vector Databases:</b> Traditional keyword search falls short in AI contexts. Semantic search understands meaning, not just words, and vector databases (like Azure AI Search or open-source options) enable fast, intelligent retrieval of similar content, critical for tasks like document analysis, recommendations, and natural language queries.</p></li>
                    <li style="color: #000000;"><p><b>🛡️ Integrate DSPM Early in the Lifecycle:</b> Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) should be embedded from the start not as an afterthought. By integrating DSPM early, you gain visibility into how sensitive data is used in AI workflows, enabling proactive risk detection, policy enforcement, and compliance without costly rework later.</p></li>
                    <li style="color: #000000;"><p><b>🤖 Use Agentic Frameworks to Automate Discovery:</b> Agentic frameworks empower AI agents to handle repetitive, time-consuming discovery tasks like scanning datasets, generating summaries, or identifying anomalies. This not only boosts productivity but also scales insight generation across large, complex data environments.</p></li>
                </ul>
